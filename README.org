This is a personal repository for experimenting with the idea of [[https://specifyapp.com/blog/becoming-a-design-tokens-ambassador][design tokens pipeline]].
On GitHub, it can receive design tokens from [[https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/888356646278934516/Design-Tokens][Design Tokens plugin for Figma]] via a webhook and pretty-print the contents.
It is basically a minimal stripped version of [[https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer][lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer]].
